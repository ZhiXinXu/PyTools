1
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,790
我要正式抗议一次
I want to register a formal protest.

2
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,210
知道了
Noted.

3
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,330
你考虑周全了吗
Have you thought of everything?

4
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,690
当然没有
Course not.

5
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,930
没必要考虑自取灭亡的事
It doesn't occur to me how to engineer my own destruction.

6
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,220
我们这样穿过了密苏里河
We crossed the Missouri like this,

7
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,810
那条河比克劳河更宽广
greater river than the Crow.

8
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,250
那时冰更厚  天更冷
Thicker ice, colder weather.

9
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,100
而且我比我的总工程师更大胆
And larger balls than my chief engineer.

10
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,450
你说了算
You're the boss.

11
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,960
谁拿着钱
Who holdin' the money?

12
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,510
-大家都加入吗  -是啊
- Everybody in? - Uh-huh.

13
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,710
那个谁  大块头
You there, big fella.

14
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,590
人们叫我帕萨姆  杜兰特先生
They call me Psalms, Mr. Durant.

15
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,450
帕萨姆  当然啦
Psalms, yes, of course, Psalms.

16
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,060
赌注是什么
What's the wager?

17
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,480
工程师过多久会跳车
How far across before the engineer jump.

18
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,760
你觉得火车过不去吗
You don't think the train's gonna make it?

19
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,010
我赌的不是铁路
I ain't bettin' against the railroad itself,

20
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:32,080
杜兰特先生  只是工程师
Mr. Durant, just the engineer.

21
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,600
当然啦
Of course.

22
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:42,630
工程师  开车过河
Engineer, take it across.

23
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:42,290
恭喜  杜兰特先生
Congratulations, Mr. Durant.

24
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,180
锅炉烧得火红  车轮飞速旋转
Red hot boiler on ice, wheels spinning.

25
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,880
不掉到冰里才怪
What'd you think was gonna happen?

之

42
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,880
水很甜
Water is sweet and good.

43
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,530
如果你们现在被印第安人袭击或放火
You get attacked by Indians now or set fire to,

44
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,240
就不用去河边取水了
won't have to go down to the river.

45
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,940
万一你不在时被袭击了呢
You'll not be here, should that happen?

46
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,500
我向你保证
Gave you my word,

47
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,190
我会等到庄稼长好  孩子生了再走
I'd be here till the crops is in, baby's born.

48
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,590
娜奥米随时都可能生
Naomi's due any day now.

49
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,950
之后唯一让我留在这里的就是达森主教
Only thing keeping me here after that'll be Bishop Dutson.

50
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,300
你对我遵守了承诺
Well, you have honored your word to me.

51
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,860
毫无疑问  他也会感觉如此
No doubt, he'll feel the same.

52
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,260
我要是走出门  他就会给我背上来一枪
I try to walk out that gate, he'll put a bullet in my back.

53
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:42,120
达森主教不是你说的那种人
Bishop Dutson is not the man you claim him to be.

54
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,790
海彻神父  我一直告诉你
Father Hatch, I keep telling you,

55
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,280
他不是他自称的那种人
he ain't the man he claims to be.

56
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,860
骗子绝对不会像达森主教那样
An imposter could never lay on hands

57
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,910
进行圣疗  讲灵言
and speak in tongues like Bishop Dutson.

58
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:57,400
是啊
Yeah.

59
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,190
总有一天你会知道的
One day you'll see.

60
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,420
关门
Close the gate!

61
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,500
-博汉南兄弟  -夏安镇怎么样
- Brother Bohannon. - How's Cheyenne?

62
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,930
一切安好
Sodom and Gomorrah's got nothing on it.

63
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,680
铁路又开始修了吗
Railroad started stockpiling rail yet?

64
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,600
遇到麻烦停工了  不过我听说
Railroad's stuck and busted. I did hear

65
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,940
骑兵队抓住了被通缉的科曼奇人
the cavalry's got the Comanche on the run, though.

66
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,180
下次注意不要剪头发
Mind you don't get a haircut next time.

67
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,610
也没多少好剪的了
Slim pickings.

68
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,550
那口新井挖得不错啊
Wonderful work on the new well.

69
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,910
小心别掉下去了
Careful you don't fall in.

70
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,210
尽量在高墙之内享受上帝赐予的宁静
Oh, try to enjoy God's peace within these walls.

71
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,670
这里这么漂亮
Fort this pretty,

72
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,520
我都快忘记自己是个囚犯了
it's hard to remember I'm a prison.

73
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,980
你是自由之人  博汉南兄弟
You are a free man, Brother Bohannon.

74
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,020
可以自由离开吗
Free to leave, you mean?

75
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,820
看到他们用拳头打架太好了
It's good to see the men fight with their fists.

76
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,020
通常他们会动刀子动枪的
Usually, they reach right for their knives and guns.

77
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,040
在河里损失的材料设备
It's the final tally for the material

78
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,100
都清点好了
lost in the river.

79
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,880
我手头没这么多钱
I don't have this kind of money on hand.

80
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:00,580
去弄  否则中太平洋公司的人会来...
Find it, or the Central Pacific will meet us here...

81
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,260
这个天杀的地方见我们
in this God forsaken place.

82
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,260
我看你妻子在这里不开心啊
Your wife is unhappy here, I take it.

83
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,190
她父亲是你的挚友
Her father was one of your best friends.

84
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,400
人失踪了你却无动于衷
He goes missing, you do nothing about it.

85
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,640
胡说  我们各处都找遍了
Well, at's not true. We looked everywhere.

86
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,160
我们真的该找时间一起吃个饭
You know, we really should have dinner sometime,

87
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:03,410
重新了解一下彼此  我可以向她解释
so we can reacquaint. I can explain it to her.

88
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,810
她肯定愿意
Oh, she'd love that,

89
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,240
因为她还担心你跟她父亲的失踪
since she worries you had something to do

90
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,660
有什么关系
with his disappearance.

91
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,620
是谁让她有这种
Who could possibly have put such a hairbrained idea

92
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,160
-愚蠢的想法的  -一个波士顿来的警探
- in her head? - A Boston detective.

93
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,110
就是去年来的那个
The one who came out here last year.

94
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,790
她父亲梅特卡夫议员
Her father, senator Metcalf,

95
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:28,390
是我多年的挚友
was one of my oldest and closest friends.

96
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,300
天呐  我是她的教父
I was her godfather, for Christ's sakes!

97
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,170
所以她才如此害怕
Well, that's what makes it so frightening for her.

98
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:43,340
我会尽可能回答她的问题
I will do everything I can to answer her questions.

99
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,370
同时你记得提醒你妻子谨慎小心
Meanwhile, advise your wife to be cautious.

100
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,730
夏安镇是个危险的地方
Cheyenne is a dangerous place.

101
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,750
伊娃
Eva?

102
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,440
你好  杜兰特先生
Howdy, Mr. Durant.

103
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,290
伊娃  你肯定可以
Eva, surely, you can find

104
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,920
找到比帮妓女洗被褥更合适的工作
something more suitable than washing whores' bedding.

105
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,520
米奇好心给我工作
Well, Mickey was good to give me the work.

106
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,780
不做这个我就得去做妓女
It's either this or go back to whoring.

107
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,510
看着我  伊娃
Look at me, Eva.

108
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:51,240
当我在破产边缘时
The eyes of the world are upon me,

109
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,570
全世界都无动于衷
as I stand on the verge of ruin.

110
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:56,460
四面楚歌  我妻子在我进监狱时
Harassed on all sides, my wife left me

111
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,950
离开了我  我没有朋友
while I was in prison, I have no friends,

112
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,990
但是你没看到我哭对吧
but you don't see me crying, do you?

113
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,410
我没哭  所以你要振作起来
No, so pick yourself up.

114
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,210
是  杜兰特先生
Yes, Mr. Durant.

115
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,010
很好
Good.

116
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,140
镇长先生
Mr. Mayor.

117
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,170
我有事相商
I am seeking counsel.

118
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:30,650
乐意为我的选民效劳
Always happy to oblige one of my constituents.

119
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,070
铁路破产了
Ahh. The railroad is broke.

120
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,190
换做是你  你会怎么做
If you were me, what would you do?

121
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:53,980
先生  根据以往经验  你肯定会回东部
Historically, sir, you'd have gone back east

122
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,740
靠兜售假文书敛财数百万
And sold a bunch of phony paper for millions of dollars,

123
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,300
但是弄沉火车之后
But after sinking the train,

124
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,220
你的信誉恐怕大不如前了
I'd say you have credibility concerns.

125
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,490
没错  换做你会怎么做
Correct, so what would you do now?

126
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,860
把值钱的资产悉数抛售
Sell off anything you have of value,

127
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,900
这块怀表也不例外
including that watch.

128
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,650
我出价五美元
I'll give you a fiver for it.

129
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,550
我手上还有地  铁路两边各20英亩
I have land, 20 acres either side of the track,

130
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:26,670
以及开采权归我所有的其他地皮
and any land I can claim mineral rights to.

131
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:33,060
你应该把那些地  全拍卖掉
You should sell it... at auction.

132
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:37,410
而你  应该把那些地都买下来
And you should buy it, at auction.

133
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,260
我不想买
I don't want it,

134
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,720
我也不想惹上麻烦
And I don't want that kind of trouble.

135
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,860
我把你送上镇长宝座  让你盆满钵盈
I made you mayor. I made you rich.

136
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:51,500
你乍到时还是个只会傻笑的戏法匠
You arrived with a magic show and a dopey smile.

137
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,480
我可以让你走时的境况更惨
You could leave with a lot less.

138
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,800
给我发个告示  弄得正规点儿
Post a notice, something official.

139
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,830
还有  带够现钱
Oh, and bring cash.

140
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,600
还有  看在上帝的份上  拉伊娃一把
And for god sakes, get Eva out of the mud.

141
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,200
有些人偏喜欢身陷泥潭不愿人帮忙
Some people don't want to be pulled out of the mud,

142
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,550
杜兰特先生
Mr. Durant.

143
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,670
没错
True.

144
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,370
千万别当那种傻子
Don't be one of them.

145
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,300
来
Here.

146
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,310
看看报纸吧
Go ahead and read it.

147
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,950
冬天之后铁路施工落下了不少
Your railroad's fallen behind during the winter.

148
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,690
杜兰特有列火车沉到克劳河里去了
Durant sunk a train into the Crow River

149
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,780
还说只是小麻烦
and called it a minor setback, so...

150
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,670
他遇到了麻烦  可能因为没有你帮忙
He struggles, probably 'cause you're not there.

151
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:17,180
总工程师马丁·德兰尼今天说
"Chief engineer Martin Delaney announced today."

152
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,290
混帐  真不敢相信
Damn it! I can't believe this.

153
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,610
怎么了
What is it?

154
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:24,650
真想不到
I can't believe

155
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:27,900
杜兰特还没炒了马丁·德兰尼那个白痴
Durant hadn't fired that idiot Martin Delaney by now.

156
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,690
我已经撵走他一次了
I beat him out for the job once already.

157
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,770
我知道那项铁路工程对你多重要
I know how much that railroad means to you.

158
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,360
你是来修铁路的
You came out here to build it,

159
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,150
而不是跟一个你可能压根就不爱的妻子
Not live a life among people who aren't your own,

160
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,910
生活在一群不相干的人中
with a wife that you may not love.

161
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,730
我来到铁路上
Come to the railroad huntin'...

162
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,100
是为了找到谋杀我妻儿的凶手
the men who murdered my wife and child.

163
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,600
能找到的都被我手刃了
Killed the ones I could find.

164
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,650
所以  娜奥米
Now, Naomi...

165
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,350
你的老公是个杀人犯
You're married to a killer.

166
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,720
你只是想让我害怕到不敢爱你
You're just tryin' to scare me into not lovin' you

167
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,100
然后离开这里
so you can leave.

168
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,740
不  我只是实话实说
No, I'm just bein' truthful is all.

169
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,340
放心走吧  卡伦
You can leave, Cullen.

170
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,790
我不会有事儿的
I'll be all right.

171
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:28,380
夏安报

172
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,120
谢谢
Thank you.

173
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,490
很不错
It's quite all right.

174
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,920
吃面包吗  丈夫
Bread, husband?

175
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,510
为什么不坐下来  休息一下
Why don't you have a seat? Rest a spell.

176
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,360
就像这样
There you go.

177
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,120
我很高兴
Well, I'm glad.

178
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,850
跟我们相处了四个月  你终于有了朋友
After four months among us, you're making friends.

179
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,690
只有一个朋友
I can count 'em all on one finger.

180
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,210
杜特利兄弟呢
Brother Dultey.

181
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,400
会你来我往的说几句话
I talk to him, he talks to me.

182
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:44,130
他从夏安镇回来之后尤甚
Especially when he returns from his trips to Cheyenne.

183
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:52,670
忘了夏安镇吧  都是过去的事了
Let go of Cheyenne, your former life.

184
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:05,610
我想和你说点事  主教
I want to talk to you about something, bishop.

185
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:06,530
什么事
Yes?

186
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,970
你之前说过的关于自由的事
That thing you said about freedom earlier.

187
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,740
我觉得我终于明白了
I think I finally understand it.

188
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,660
很好
Good. Good!

189
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,990
-还有别的  -什么
- And--and something else. - Mm-hmm?

190
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,200
我看到了神启幻象
I had me a vision.

191
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,000
说来听听
Tell me.

192
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:37,710
在幻象中我离开了这个地方
I had me a vision that I was leaving this place.

193
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,740
为什么呢
But why?

194
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:47,290
这里还有...很多你未完成的事情
Th-there's still... so much to be done with you.

195
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,560
我不知道  我只是...
I don't know, I just...

196
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,520
看见自己径直走过了那扇门
Saw myself walkin' straight through that gate.

197
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,500
南北战争时南方邦联的国歌

198
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,500
-不  -径直穿过了那扇门  吹着《迪克西》
- No, no. - Walkin' right out through that gate, whistling Dixie.

199
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:06,800
你不能抛弃你的妻儿
You--you would not abandon your wife and child.

200
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:12,620
是的
Yeah.

201
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,450
不用担心
I wouldn't worry none.

202
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,310
只是幻象而已
It's just a vision.

203
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:44,950
坎贝尔先生  格兰特将军可以见你了
Mr. Campbell, General Grant will see you now.

204
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,100
格兰特将军
General Grant.

205
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:56,420
我已当选  我要把你派到西部  坎贝尔
With my election assured, I'm sending you west, Campbell.

206
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,780
怀俄明  听说过吗
Wyoming. Ever hear of it?

207
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,350
-略有耳闻  -无法无天的地方
- Vaguely. - Lawless place.

208
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,990
联合太平洋公司已经深陷其中
Union Pacific has gotten itself bogged down out there.

209
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,610
那里现在一片混乱
Things are running amok.

210
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,380
我不认为我是去那里的合适人选
I don't think I'm the man you want to send there.

211
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,110
你不会回到亚特兰大的
You will not be returning to Atlanta.

212
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,990
我在那里的工作还没有结束
My work there is incomplete.

213
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,200
我这是为你好  坎贝尔
I'm saving you from yourself, campbell.

214
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,820
你做得有点过了
You were a bit overzealous.

215
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,360
错误已经铸成  但秩序也恢复了
Mistakes were made, but order was restored.

216
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,020
希望你当怀俄明临时州长时也能如此
And you'll do the same as the provisional governor of wyoming.

217
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,050
好运  先生
Good luck, sir.

218
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:45,500
将军  很荣幸得到这个机会  
General, you honor me with this opportunity.

219
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:56,900
混乱的街头  夏安镇陷入动荡和无序

220
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:02,750
功利主义名言  提倡不择手段达到福利最大化

221
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,130
为最多的人
The greatest good

222
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,750
谋求最大的幸福是我们的目标
to the greatest number is the object to attain.

223
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:06,440
这需要人和财产的安全
This requires security of person and property in every--

224
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:09,630
先生们  将军对我们在
Gentlemen, the general is very pleased

225
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:12,000
亚特兰大的成功非常满意
with our success in Atlanta.

226
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,000
他不会免去我们的职务吗
He's not giving us the boot?

227
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,320
恰恰相反
On the contrary,

228
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,910
他任命我管理一块新领地
he appointed me governor of a new territory.

229
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,970
-哪一个  -怀俄明
- Which one? - Wyoming.

230
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,760
-没听说过  -尚待开发的边疆
- Never heard of it. - The frontier.

231
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,500
那是荒蛮之地
It's a wilderness.

232
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,530
这比被免职还惨
This is worse than getting the boot.

233
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:29,660
别这么快下结论  西部有黄金
Well, not so fast. There's gold out west.

234
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:30,970
自由之地
Free land out here,

235
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:34,310
对于有远见的人来说机会大把
opportunities for those with a keen eye.

236
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,210
那里不是汪洋大盗肆虐的地盘
This is not a place of hooded rascals,

237
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,240
废墟之城
a city in ashes.

238
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:45,580
那里确实很荒芜  但也百废待兴  
It's wild, surely, but so is an unbroken horse.

239
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,960
我们将推倒废墟
We'll break it.

240
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:51,720
你会成为整个领地的临时治安官
You'll be provisional marshal of the whole territory.

241
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:53,620
你会是法官
You'll be the judge.

242
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,500
你会是财政部长
You'll be the treasurer.

243
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,070
这些都是格兰特说的吗
Grant says all this?

244
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:03,000
收拾行李  别拿显眼的毛毡包
Pack your gear. No carpet bags.

245
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,530
怀俄明
Wyoming.

246
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,680
早上好  先生们
Good morning, gentlemen.

247
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,480
今早你们有难得的机会
This morning, you have a rare opportunity

248
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,660
购买一些很有价值的土地
to buy some very valuable land.

249
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:25,860
谁有兴趣拍下山谷北侧的二十一号土地
Now, what bid do I hear for parcel 21 in the North Valley?

250
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,880
我真不想卖这块心头肉
It breaks my heart to offer it.

251
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,210
我们也不想买  那里是自由放养区
Ours too. It's open range.

252
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,750
万一有人圈占了怎么办
What if somebody fences it in?

253
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,360
正如你说的  那片自由放养区
That open range, as you call it,

254
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,570
是联合太平洋铁路公司授权的
was granted by the largess of the Union Pacific Railroad.

255
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,450
四百美元
$400.

256
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,540
五百美元
$500.

257
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:48,230
五百美元  出价是五百美元  先生们
$500. The bid is $500, gentlemen.

258
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,310
有没有更高的
And the advance?

259
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,520
五百零一美元
$501.

260
00:22:56,910 --> 00:23:03,200
五百零一美元  一次  两次
$501. Going once, going twice...

261
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,630
六百美元
$600.

262
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,070
帕默夫人
Mrs. Palmer.

263
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,460
这是在干什么  托马斯
Just what is this stunt, Thomas?

264
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,430
这是拍卖会  玛吉
This is an auction, Maggie.

265
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,450
我看到了
Hmm, I see that.

266
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,190
我以为对联太铁路公司的土地咱们有过协议
I thought we had an agreement about the use of this U.P. Land

267
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,300
要作为自由放养区
for free range.

268
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,250
是的  不管是谁赢得拍卖  也许你可以
Yes, and perhaps you can strike a similar deal with the new owner,

269
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,710
和那位新地主达成协议
whomever that may be.

270
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:26,800
我已经和你达成了协议  杜兰特  永久的
I struck a deal with you, Durant, in perpetuity.

271
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,980
而你却跟你的走狗违反了协议
Now, you're reneging behind your flunky here.

272
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:33,430
我不是走狗  我是夏安镇的镇长
I'm not a flunky. I'm the mayor of Cheyenne.

273
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,200
你要是想挑起牧区战争
If you're looking for a range war,

274
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,790
只要说声"拉铁丝网"就行
just say, "Barbed wire".

275
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,860
我想要的是六百美元拍卖金
I'm looking at a bid of $600.

276
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,290
六百零一美元
$601.

277
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,130
一千
$1,000.

278
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,500
一千零一

把梯子放下来  主教

285
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,650
博汉南兄弟  我已经考虑过

286

你预见自己要离开我们的事了

还记得你最后一次不得不在暴力中

288
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:11,190
拔枪  或动手吗

289
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:13,500
现在的生活不是充满平静吗
Isn't there a peace in that?

290
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,250
我原本期待把洞挖深
I was hoping digging this hole into the earth

291
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,540
能给予你深思熟虑的时间

292
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,760
可以提醒你

293

我们对回归光明的需求

上帝让我降临人间拯救你的灵魂  博汉南兄弟
God has put me on earth to save your soul, brother Bohannon.

295
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,450
我知道你对那深信不疑

296

不要拒绝第二次机会

年轻漂亮的妻子  还有宝贝儿子

298
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,010
我们交谈时他也许正要呱呱坠地

299
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,320
给我梯子
The ladder.

300
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,100
上帝已经告诉我她会生男孩  知道吗
God has spoken to me that it is a boy, you know?

301
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,200
-卡伦  -把梯子放下来

309
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,350
是吗  你怎么说
Yeah? What'd you tell him?

310
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:38,140
什么都没说  我以为你喜欢这里
Nothin', I thought you liked it here.

311
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,720
不  我们必须在外面等
No, we wait.

312
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,300
见鬼去吧
To hell with that.

313
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,100
卡伦  求你了
Cullen, please!

314
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:54,880

00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:59,020
别让那个狗娘养的靠近我妻子
I don't want that sumbitch anywhere near my wife.

316
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,630
分娩出现了点困难
There seems to be a difficulty in the birthing.

317
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:06,910
她恳求那个异教徒进来

318
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,270

没事的
It's okay.

325
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:39,210
你得把孩子转过来
You're gonna have to turn the baby.

326
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:40,530
我们正在努力

331
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,210
但我们失去了一对双胞胎

332
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,420
快一点
Do it.

00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:02,730
不会有事的
It's all right.

335
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:06,750
你让我成了玛吉·帕莫和那群牧民的仇人
And you made me an enemy of Maggie Palmer and her cattlemen.

336
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,270
准确地说是一群赶牛的乡巴佬
Shitkickers and cow-punchers.

337
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,230
她说我是你的走狗
She called me your flunky.

338
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,840
大餐里总会有沙子

341
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,390
第二大的产权人
in the entire Wyoming territory.

342
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:25,490
你把我榨干了
You wiped me out.

343
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:29,930
我只是把钱从一个账转到了另一个账上
Merely transferring money from one ledger to another.

344
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:30,560
谢谢

我们在天上的父
Our father, who art in heaven.

353
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,410
该死  我忘了后面的

行在地上
On earth...

请饶恕我们的过犯
And forgive us our trespasses,

360
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,840
就像我们饶恕他人的过犯一样
as we forgive those who trespass against us.

361
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,530
粗心的婊子

泥浆让你好看点了

你该第一个抱他

Naomi is young and healthy and will outlive her husbands,

419

420
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:17,610
从你离开以后开始
beginning with you.

421
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,940
天呐
Jesus.

422
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,180
过来吧
Get over here.

423
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:10,690
你怎么了
What happened to you?

424
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,570
我为你尽力了  伊娃
I've done all I can for you, Eva.

425
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,370
我给了你两次离开这里的车费
Twice I gave you train fare out of this place,

426
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:18,290
而你依然没有离开
And you still don't leave.

427
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,420
这个世界没有我的容身之处  米奇
There's no place for me in this world, Mickey.

428
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,330
这都是你自找的
You bring it all on yourself.

429
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,660
你跟黑鬼厮混
You involved yourself with a...Negro.

430
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,370
我爱埃兰
I loved Elam.

431
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,450
你要是真爱他
You loved him so much

432
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:44,250
怎么会送走他深爱的孩子
that you gave away the baby that he adored.

433
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,590
这不对
That ain't right.

434
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:00,030
你就不该放弃卖身
You should never have left off the whoring.

435
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,340
这行你最拿手
You were good at that.

436
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,940
与生俱来
A natural.

437
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,700
所有女人生来都是妓女
All women are whores by nature...

438
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,480
除了我妈以外
I suppose except for me mum.

439
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:30,410
这是女人唯一的共同点
It's the one thing that all women have in common.

440
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,570
她们只会卖
Whoring.

441
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:41,680
她们只是妓女
Just whores.

442
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,220
归根结底
At the end of the day...

443
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:48,960
她们都是妓女
They're all whores.

444
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,280
你现在满意了吗
Is everything where you thought it would be?

445
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:57,640
什么
What?

446
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:03,770
我说  你现在满意了吗
I said, "Is everything where you thought it would be?"

447
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:07,940
我
I--

448
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:10,960
我没有...
I wouldn't--

449
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:14,250
我不是有意的
Didn't mean to.

450
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:33,500
玛吉  加入我吧
Maggie! Join me.

451
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,070
在今天之前我还挺喜欢你的
I actually liked you until today.

452
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,420
你依然喜欢我
Oh, you still like me.

453
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,870
你只是不信任我  这非常正常
You just don't trust me. That's perfectly normal.

454
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:46,790
我必须那样做  玛吉  我需要钱
I had to do it, Maggie. I needed the money.

455
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:51,550
所以你现在独坐于此  带着你的钱
So here you sit with your money, alone.

456
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:57,470
我在等待领地的新州长
I'm expecting the new governor of the territory.

457
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:59,020
他的火车晚点了
His train is late.

458
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:03,470
总有一天  当你需要信任之人时
One day, you will need someone that you can trust.

459
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:07,340
你只会找到一整屋的空椅子
All you'll find is a room of...Empty chairs.

460
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,950
我也有那样的包
I have bags just like those.

461
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,910
这些是你的包
Oh, those are your bags,

462
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,590
这是你的账单
And here is your bill.

463
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,150
账单
Bill?

464
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:35,980
我猜你会来威胁我
Figured you'd bring the threat.

465
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,020
我是来讲和的
A plea.

466
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,590
你嘴里的话总是真假难辨
Well, things can be two at once in your mouth.

467
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:42,740
你直接杀了我
You kill me outright,

468
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,690
人们就会看到你的本来面目
you'll be seen for what you are.

469
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:48,950
我直接杀了你
Hmm. I kill you outright,

470
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,200
你就会变成某种圣人  而我会被吊死
You'd be some kind of saint, and I'd hang.

471
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:55,970
一旦你踏出这扇门
Once outside those gates,

472
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:00,110
我就不能保证你的安全
I cannot guarantee your safety.

473
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:04,220
我们的安全  我要带家人一起走
Our safety. Taking my family with me.

474
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,610
你的家人
Your family?

475
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,180
没错
That's right.

476
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,090
你不允许我离开
You not allowing me to leave...

477
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,200
做这决定是达森主教
Is that as Bishop Dutson,

478
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:44,970
还是瑞典佬  或者说托尔·刚德森
Or as the Swede, also known as Thor Gundersen?

479
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:50,770
过世的托尔·刚德森是挪威人
The late Thor Gundersen was Norwegian.

480
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:56,630
那么
Well...

481
00:41:58,820 --> 00:41:59,990
不管你是谁
Whoever you are...

482
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:03,800
你最好瞄准点
You better shoot to kill.

483
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:10,030
因为我会回来了结一切恩怨
I'm coming back to finish this once and for all.
